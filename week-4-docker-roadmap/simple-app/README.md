Got it 👍 you want a **short + simple README** that just explains what you did:

````markdown
# Simple Node.js App with Docker

This project demonstrates how to create a Dockerfile, build a Docker image, and run it as a container.

---

## 🐳 Steps

### 1. Create Dockerfile
The `Dockerfile` defines how to build the image:
```dockerfile
FROM node:18
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "index.js"]
````

---

### 2. Build the Image

Run this in the project root (where `Dockerfile` is located):

```bash
docker build -t my-node-app .
```

---

### 3. Run the Container

Start a container from the image:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-node-app
```

Now the app is running inside Docker.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser 🎉

---

## ✅ Summary

* **Dockerfile** → instructions to build the image
* **docker build** → create image from Dockerfile
* **docker run** → start container from the image

```

---

👉 Do you want me to also add **commands for stopping/removing the container** (so the README covers the full lifecycle)?
```
