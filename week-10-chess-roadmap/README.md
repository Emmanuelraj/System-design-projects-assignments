Perfect! Let’s create a **single-page visual roadmap + architecture diagram** that combines:

* **Roadmap steps** (WebSocket → Room → Redis → React → Monorepo → Chess logic)
* **Architecture flow** (Client ↔ WebSocket server ↔ Redis)

Here’s a version you can directly use in your README with **Mermaid**:

# Chess Application Roadmap + Architecture

This diagram combines the **step-by-step roadmap** and **system architecture** for building a real-time chess application.

```mermaid

    %% Roadmap Steps
    subgraph Roadmap [Roadmap Steps]
        A[Step 1: WebSocket Server]
        B[Step 2: Room-Based Architecture]

        D[Step 4: Basic ReactJS Frontend]
        E[Step 5: Monorepo Setup]
        F[Step 6: Chess Application Logic]
    end

    %% Architecture Flow

    Client2 -- WebSocket --> WS_Server
    WS_Server -- Save/Fetch State --> Redis
    WS_Server -- Pub/Sub --> Redis

### How to Use This Diagram

1. **Follow the roadmap sequentially**:

   1. WebSocket server → understand real-time communication
   2. Room-based architecture → manage multi-user games
   3. Redis → persist state and learn pub/sub
   4. React frontend → minimal UI for testing moves
   5. Monorepo → organize server + client cleanly
   6. Chess logic → adapt WS + Redis for real-time chess

2. **System Architecture Flow**:

   * Two clients connect to a WS server
   * WS server handles rooms and broadcasts moves
   * Redis stores game state and enables pub/sub for scaling

---

### Outcome

By following this roadmap and architecture, you will have:

* Fully working real-time chess app
* Solid understanding of WebSockets, Redis, and backend architecture
* Minimal React frontend for testing
* Monorepo project setup for scalable codebase

```

This **one diagram combines both roadmap and system architecture** — it’s perfect for keeping your focus while coding.
